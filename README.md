<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Embark on a magical journey with Mah≈ç & Books!

Upon entering the world, each player is bestowed with a singular magic type and a designated Magic Power value, setting the stage for an immersive and captivating experience.

Explore the realm to uncover new treasures, including the coveted Grimoires, magical books infused with power. These Grimoires unlock the potential to cast epic spells, allowing you to wield extraordinary abilities and shape the destiny of your Minecraft adventure.

Drawing inspiration from the anime Black Clover, Mah≈ç introduces 18 distinct magic types (and more to come in the future), each with its own unique playstyle and an array of awe-inspiring spells. Dive into a world where your chosen magic type defines your journey and strategy.

However, fate's whims may intervene ‚Äì test your luck to discover high-tier Grimoires, elevating your magical prowess to new heights. Alternatively, face the challenge of being born without magic, adding an extra layer of complexity to your Minecraft experience.

Unleash the power within, embrace the magic, and let the enchantment of Mah≈ç transport you to a Minecraft realm like never before!
